//value type variable; value of variables is stored in JS memory 
//arrays not the same; JS stores reference to the array in memory 
//arrays are stored as reference types 

//ex: 

let nums =[6,6,7,8];
let otherNums=nums;//will return undefined 

//ex 2 of variable 

num2=122222;
otherNums2=num2;
console.log(num2);// returns 122222
